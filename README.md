# Portfolio

### Hi, welcome! I'm Mateo, degree in Business and soon in AI & Data Science. In this repo, you will find some of my projects as a Data Scientist, all of them done in academic environments and with the main purpose of learning and getting into the data science world.

### Currently, you can find different folders with the projects as well as another with some random code about machine learning theory and practical exercices.

### The README file is under construction. Until I get it clean and nice, please, if you have any doubt or need to dig deeper in some part of the code, do not hesitate on contacting me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateo-carlos-comba-42b886140.

### Thanks for reading :)
