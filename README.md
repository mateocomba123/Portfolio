## Portfolio

#### Hi, welcome! I'm Mateo, degree in Business and very soon in AI & Data Science. Experienc of 2 years working with data in the tourism sector as a controlling analyst, and lately in petrol (YPF Argentina) as a data analyst & BI developer. In this repo, you will find some of my projects as a Data Scientist, all of them done in academic environments and with the main purpose of learning and getting into the data science world.

#### Currently, you can find different folders with the projects as well as another with some random code about machine learning theory and practical exercices.

##### - Glassdoor Salaries Project: This original author is Ken Jee, who through a web scraper made in Selenium, collected glassdoor jobs offers, and then done a machine learning project with the aim of predict job salaries based in the collected features. My personal contribution to this project was with the web scraper, that I re-built because one year after the original publication, it wasn't working as expected, as well as I added new features that the first one wasn't collecting, such as culture the company ranking in some aspects (values, work&life balance, career opportunities, etc). I'm currently working in these project, so I will share with u the EDA, modelling and set up in production stages as soon as I get it done.

##### - Keystroke Dynamics project: This project was done entirely in University classes, in collaboration with classmates and teachers. Our hypothesis was: "The way people writes in a keyboard can identify themselves, so it could be a good second factor for authentication systems". To make that experiment, we asked people to write a specific sentence many times and took the time they hold a key, the time between they released one and holded the next one, etc. These times will be our features in our supervised classification problem, being the target the actual name of the person who completed the task. As a conclusion, with a L2 logistic regression, we obtained surprisingly good results. It seems like the way we write in a keyboard can identify ourselves and differenciate us from other people. In conclusion, seems reasonable to think a keystroke dynamics as a second factor authentication.

##### - Academic chatbot: This was a University project with one clear objective: build an academic informational chatbot. It was made from scratch, using NLTK and Stanford libraries for NLP tasks and Sklearn in the machine larning ones. We divided the chatbot in different "Brains" that are the models in charge of the predictions looking for the career is interested for, the intention (just chat, get general information, pay, get contact, etc), the subintention and the w5 (who, what, where, when, why). We put everything together with a simple UI and get pretty good results, the chatbot answers the questions we make in an acceptable percentage of total, and of not, it ask to enter the question again. The model is not in production yet, but hopefully it will be soon.

#### The README file is under construction. Until I get it clean and nice, please, if you have any doubt or need to dig deeper in some part of the code, do not hesitate on contacting me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateo-carlos-comba-42b886140.

#### Thanks for reading :)
