Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.



Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.



Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.



Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.



Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.



Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.



Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.



Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.



Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.



Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.



Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise."	4.1	"Cogo Labs

143	Allergic Disease Physician-Scientist, NIBR	$68K - $114K (Glassdoor est.)	"235 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, and the prevalence of food allergy ranges from 1-3% in adults and 4-6% in children. Novartis is committed to developing new treatments for allergic diseases, including asthma, food allergy and chronic spontaneous urticaria, as well as diseases across a wide range of therapeutic areas.

The Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) is the innovation engine of Novartis that collaborates across the company and beyond, focusing on powerful new technologies that have the potential to help produce therapeutic breakthroughs for patients. Translational Medicine (TM) is the clinical research arm of NIBR, and includes about 900 associates globally. TM plays a pivotal role in bringing innovative medicines to patients, by building on research advances to develop new therapies, and bridging drug discovery and clinical application.

TM Discovery & Profiling (TMDP) is a group of physicians and clinical researchers who drive that innovative science from discovery to the patient through the selection, profiling, and effective development of medicines. Translational medicine experts oversee Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to demonstrate proof of concept in patients, creating the case for drugs to proceed to late-stage development and registration. Translational medicine experts are also responsible for clinical pharmacology and mechanistic studies that support Phase 3 development.
We are currently seeking to hire an allergist who is a physician-scientist to join the TMDP group as a translational medicine expert. Translational medicine experts are key and highly visible members of global cross-functional project teams. The teams design and implement early research and discovery projects, which culminate in clinical proof-of-concept studies. Translational medicine experts become involved in projects at the onset, collaborating with colleagues in biology and chemistry to identify targets in diseases with significant unmet medical needs and providing input on likely clinical development pathways. As the project transitions from laboratory based research to the clinic, the translational medicine expert assumes leadership of the cross-functional team. Results from successful proof-of-concept studies allow the teams to make rational decisions on whether a project should proceed to full development. The proof-of-concept studies are identified as one of the most critical steps in drug development at Novartis. After proof-of-concept and if the program proceeds to full development, the translational medicine expert continues as a key member of the full development team up to and including registration.

The primary responsibilities of a translational medicine expert are:

This role could be based in Cambridge, MA or Basel, Switzerland.

What you will bring to the role:

o five plus years of clinical experience with relevant patient groups at an academic medical center
o Three plus years of experience in a pharmaceutical company or clinical research organization
o Related clinical trial experience within a related discipline
